Javascript Class model is based on Self.

It featured an early object literal notation and 
dynamic object programming in which object properties could be added and deleted during program execution.

A dog object is an instance of the Dog Class.
Objects have access to a bunch of functions known as instance functions.

Now that you know where we’ve been and where we are, you can think about the three ways of creating JavaScript objects:
• From nothing (ex nihilo, often using object notation) const obj = {}.
• From OOP class-like functions
• From prototype objects

Properties may be added to objects any time that you choose
Rubyists call it meta programming

Arrays and functions are also objects in JavaScript. 
Here an array literal creates an array.
