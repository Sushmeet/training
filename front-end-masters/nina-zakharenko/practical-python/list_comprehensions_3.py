#Comprehensions
# Letâ€™s practice our comprehensions. 
# Create a list of only odd numbers between 0 and 100 using a list comprehension. 
# Then, use a comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are the even 
# numbers from your list, and the values are random integers between 0 and 100 
# (hint: try random.randint(min, max)). 
# Finally, use a comprehension to create a set of every unique value from the above dictionary.
