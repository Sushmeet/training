// Type checking, looking for compaitbility or type equivalence
// == looks for if value is equal === strick equal looks for both value and type being equal
// 3 === '3' false
// 3 == '3' true

// Static vs dynamic

// Sorting Type Systems as static or dynamic has to do with whther type checking/equivalence is done at compile
// time or run time.

// Static type system means type check is done at compile time.
// Dynamic type system means type check is done at run time.

// java has a nominal type system, meaning it cares about which class you come from, or which
// class are u an instance of.

// typescript is a structaral type system meaning it only cares to see if the structure of ur type is the same
// it doesn't matter whether u are an instance of a class, or an object literal that is being passed in
// as long as structure matters it's all good.

// Duck typing, very similar to structural typing , is usually used to describe dynamic type systems.

// Strong typing vs weak typing. No real meaning actually in these words
// Strong generaly just means Static typing, and weak just means dynamic typing
