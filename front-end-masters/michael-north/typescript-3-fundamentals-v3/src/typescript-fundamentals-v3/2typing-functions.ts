// always define ur return path for a function. so ur type.
// So it's imp because when you put a return type than u will
// see the problem where its truly happening.
// if u don't specify a return type than u might see the problem
// at the function invocation level, but it's a lot of noise at that point
// also u don't see the problem at the root where you should actually be fixing it.

// U still have to write unit tests, because typescript does not check behaviour
// that's still javascript. Yes u don't need to check types anymore , but other than
// that u still need to write ur unit tests.
