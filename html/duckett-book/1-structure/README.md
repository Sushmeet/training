1. Html Pages are text documents.
1. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
1. Tags are often referred to as elements.
1. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
1. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
1. Attributes require a name and a value.
1. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
