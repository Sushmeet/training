## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Curriculum

Tech wise here is what I can tell you tech wise:

- know the next js data fetching basics: ssg, ssr, isr, swr and potentially middleware.
- understand how they apply to experiments and how to maximize core web vitals
- make sure you read react 18 and know server components. Not in details but the big ideas.
- understand “the edge” and cool new web techs in broad stroke, just keep a bit up to date with tu blogs and twitter etc
- react optimization basics (callback, memo, lifting state up)
